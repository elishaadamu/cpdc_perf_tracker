Just 32.5% of stream miles in Pennsylvania are in attainment of water quality standards to support aquatic life as of 2024. In New Jersey, just 12.8% of watershed acres meet the standards to support aquatic life as of 2022. These figures are, unfortunately, getting worse. From 2014 to 2022, the percentage of the region’s waterbodies attaining water quality standards declined by 2.8%. Pennsylvania saw a more dramatic decrease in water bodies attainment—dropping by 6.2% from 2014 to 2024, versus New Jersey, which dropped by just 0.4% from 2014 to 2022, the latest year of New Jersey data available.
