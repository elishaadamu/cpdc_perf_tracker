While neighborhoods in the region are slowly diversifying in terms of race, ethnicity, and income, much more work is needed to achieve the vision of an environmentally just, integrated region. Over a 33-year period, racial and ethnic segregation declined steadily each year. Income segregation effectively remained the same until 2018, with a slight decline since then. 

In 1990, 68.6% of the region's population would have, theoretically, needed to move to another census tract in order to have equally diverse neighborhoods by race and ethnicity throughout the region. This declined to 54.2% by 2018 and even further to 50.8% by 2023. Other research has found a [slight decrease in racial and ethnic segregation](https://penniur.upenn.edu/publications/ten-ways-covid-19-changed-americas-cities-or-maybe-not#poverty-reductions-surprising-progress-but-will-it-stick) in the nation’s urban areas since the Covid pandemic. 

The region’s Income Segregation Index was 39.7% in 2023, just 1.4% below its value in 1990. This means 39.7% of the population would need to move in order to have equally diverse census tracts by income level. Research has also found a [slight trend in decreasing concentrations of poverty](https://penniur.upenn.edu/publications/ten-ways-covid-19-changed-americas-cities-or-maybe-not#poverty-reductions-surprising-progress-but-will-it-stick) in the nation’s urban areas since the pandemic.
