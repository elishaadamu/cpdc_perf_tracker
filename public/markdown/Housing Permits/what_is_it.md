Housing permit data is derived from reports and publications compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau's Residential Construction Statistics Division. Municipalities provide the U.S. Census Bureau with tabulations of the number of housing units authorized, according to types of structures. In the few cases where municipalities reported building permit approvals for some months but not for all 12 months, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the total yearly number of units approved based on past yearsâ€™ approvals.

The *Connections 2050* Plan defines four planning areas in the region: Core Cities, Developed Communities, Growing Suburbs, and Rural Areas. The first chart shows the trendline for percentage of housing units approved in Core Cities and Developed Communities since 1980. Plan Centers are the most appropriate development areas in the *Connections 2050* Plan. Since they do not always align with Census geographies, they cannot be tracked for permit activity.

The second chart shows the count of all units approved in all four Planning Areas.

The third chart presents units authorized by structure type. Note that mobile homes are not included in residential building permits data. The following are definitions of structure types used:

* *Single-family* are single-unit structures, including attached, detached and semi-detached, and row houses, provided the units are separated by a ground-to-roof party wall.
* *Small multifamily* structures are those containing two to four units, including duplexes and triplexes.
* *Large multifamily* structures are those with five or more units. Garden apartments and high-rise buildings are included in this category, as well as condominiums and cooperatively owned apartment buildings.

All three charts show trends both annually and cumulatively since the base year 1980.
