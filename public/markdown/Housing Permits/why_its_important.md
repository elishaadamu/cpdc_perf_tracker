Residential construction permit approvals can indicate the health of the region's real estate sector and general desirability. Where that construction occurs can also indicate if the region is growing in a sustainable manner. The *Connections 2050* Plan sets a goal to focus growth in areas appropriate for development—including more than 130 walkable Plan Centers across the region along with Core Cities and Developed Community Planning Areas—where transportation and utility infrastructure can support new development and growth that doesn’t come at the expense of natural habitats and resources. Development in growing suburbs and rural areas is often at a lower density that requires more infrastructure provision and a loss of open space, which leads to longer vehicle trips, an increase in congestion, and more emissions.
