In 1980, nearly two thirds of permits were issued in Core Cities and Developed Communities. Afterwards, this value steadily declined to a low point of just one third of the region’s approvals occurring in appropriate growth areas in 1999. Since then, that figure steadily increased to 70% in 2019 before declining back to 62.1% in 2024. The high number of permits approved in 2021 was caused by a surge in development applications seeking to capitalize on Philadelphia’s tax abatement program before it expired.

Chart 2 shows the total number of housing permits approved in all Planning Areas peaked—outside of 2021—in themid-1980s before declining during the early 1990s recession. Permit issuance was relatively stable through the rest of 1990s and 2000s leading up to the Great Recession with between 13,600 and 19,200 annually. Permitting increased slowly coming out of the Great Recession, but has been lower overall at 11,600 to 15,000 each year since 2013—aside from the 2021 peak.

Chart 3 illustrates a gradual shift to more multifamily approvals up to the end of the pandemic, and then a shift back to more single family approvals from 2022 onward. Multifamily approvals peaked in 2019 at 61% of the total. After a peak of 94% of approvals in 1992, single family units gradually declined to 39% in 2019 (excluding the 2021 anomaly), before rising back to 53% in 2024.
