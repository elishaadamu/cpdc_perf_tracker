By 2019, total regional heat-trapping gases have been reduced by approximately 30% per person since 2005, or 27% overall. The largest driver of these reductions was changes in the electricity generation mix, primarily the continued switch from coal to natural gas. The portion of our electricity generated from coal dropped from 44.9% in 2004 to just 4.7% in 2023. Because natural gas emits less CO<sub>2</sub> per kilowatt hour of electricity produced than coal does, the switch has lowered heat-trapping gases overall. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel that produces CO<sub>2</sub> when combusted and the switch from coal to natural gas is mostly complete. Further heat-trapping gas reductions from this source are limited.

Since our region’s weather is impacted by global heat-trapping gases, its average annual temperatures and total daily average precipitation continue to rise. The region’s 30-year mean of average annual temperature increased by 3 degrees, or 5.9%, from 1924 to 2024. Its 30-year mean of total daily average precipitation increased by 4.1 inches, or 9.1%, from 1901 to 2024. These figures are projected to continue to worsen without continued efforts to reduce heat-trapping gases on a regional, national, and global scale.
