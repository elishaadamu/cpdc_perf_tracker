Reducing global heat-trapping gases is critical to slowing or even reversing global temperature increases. Many of the actions taken to reduce these gases will also improve our transportation network, clean the air, bolster public health, increase livability, and strengthen the economy. 

For more information go to DVRPC’s [Regional Power Use and Heat-Trapping Gases Inventory](https://www.dvrpc.org/EnergyClimate/Inventory/) and [Temperature and Precipitation Projections for the DVRPC Region](https://www.dvrpc.org/EnergyClimate/CCMIT/). In March, 2024 DVRPC published a *[Priority Regional Climate Action Plan](https://www.dvrpc.org/cprg/)* to inform the region’s efforts to mitigate heat-trapping gases. DVRPC expects to publish a *Comprehensive Climate Action Plan* sometime in 2026. 

DVRPC’s *[Municipal Implementation Toolbox](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/)* suggests the following tools for communities to contribute to global efforts to reduce and mitigate CO2, methane and nitrous oxide outputs:
* [Alternative Energy Ordinance](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/alternativeenergyordinance)
* [Clean Energy Supply](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/cleanenergysupply)
* [Electric Vehicles](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/electricvehicles) 
* [Heat-Trapping Gas Reduction Targets and Climate Action Plans](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/greenhousegasreductiontargetsandclimateactionplans)
* [Green Building Standards](https://www.dvrpc.org/Plan/MIT/greenbuildingstandards)
