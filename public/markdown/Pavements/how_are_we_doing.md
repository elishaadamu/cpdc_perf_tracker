In 2023, 4.2% of the region’s NHS pavement lane miles were in poor condition per the PM2 metric, which is one percent lower than in 2020. Poor condition pavement by IRI in 2023 (25.8%) declined by 6% regionally from its 2015 peak, though is still 1.1% higher than the 2010 base year. Non-NHS roadways are in much worse shape than NHS roadways by IRI. In 2023, 32% of non-NHS pavement segment miles were in poor condition, versus 23.4% of non-interstate NHS pavement segment miles, and just 7.6% of NHS interstate pavement segment miles.

In Pennsylvania, poor condition pavement by IRI was 31.3%, down 5.5% from the 2014 peak, though 5.8% higher than the 2010 base year. In 2023, there were 1,292.4 Pennsylvania segment miles in poor condition according to the same metric—a 20.6% increase from 2010. In New Jersey, poor condition pavement dropped from 22.6% of segment miles to 12.6% between 2010 and 2023 by IRI. Most counties track fairly closely with state data. However, in Philadelphia, at least half pavement segment miles experienced poor conditions according to IRI for most years between 2017 and 2023.
