Among households sharing income information, more than 755,000, or 33 percent of all households, were cost burdened—paying over 30% of income on housing—in 2023. This is down 9% from a 2011 peak of more than 834,000 (41%). Even though the region is below the 2011 peak percentage, the total number of cost-burdened households has increased every year since 2019.

Around one-third of homeowners were cost burdened between 2005 and 2011. This decreased every year through 2021 to less than a quarter of homeowners being cost burdened, with a value of 23.8% in 2023. In contrast, more than half (51%-55%) of renter households have been cost burdened over this entire period. The number of renter households (+28%) has increased faster than homeowners (+8.5%) between 2005 and 2023.

Core Cities have the highest percentage of cost-burdened households (39.3%) by Planning Area, followed by Developed Communities (31.5%). Households in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas may have lower housing costs and/or higher incomes. Households in outlying areas generally have higher transportation costs, while those in the central areas of the region are more likely to rent.

The number of households with a severe cost burden—greater than 50% of household income—increased by 11% from 2005 to 2023. 

The ratio between self-reported median regional home values and median regional incomes was 3.9 in 2023, which has increased by 15 percent since its lowest point in 2019. It remains just below the 2010 peak of 4.0, meaning the average house cost was four times annual household income most recently in that year.
