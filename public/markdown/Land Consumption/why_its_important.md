Decision-makers in the Greater Philadelphia region must balance a variety of land uses to maintain a high quality of life for its residents, workers, and visitors with the finite amount of available land. One of the most important land use decisions that our local governments face is choosing to develop land for housing, business, or industry; or to protect it as open space for recreation, water quality, habitat, natural beauty, or farmland. Over the past 75 years, land consumption has increased at a rate nearly five times the region's population growth, resulting in sprawling development patterns. There are many negative effects of this inefficient use of the region's land, including:

* greater reliance on motorized transportation, which results in more congestion on our roadways and an increased demand for new infrastructure to reduce this congestion
* additional need for redundant amenities and services as communities spread out
* longer trips, which reduce the feasibility of alternative modes and lead to more time spent traveling in vehicles—negatively affecting mental and physical health
* challenges to, if not loss of, local agricultural economies
* less ability for other species to thrive as their habitat is lost or movement between habitats is restricted
* detrimental impacts to air and water quality

At the same time, the region is a national leader in land preservation. The *Connections 2050* Plan sets a goal of preserving one million acres by 2040. This indicator also relates to the Plan’s goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, improve air and water quality, preserve historic and cultural resources, and increase local food production, distribution, and access.
