From 1990 to 2023, the region lost about 225,000 acres of agricultural land, a 35% decrease. During this same period, total developed land in the region increased by 253,000 acres (+32%). Chester County developed the most over this period, with 64,400 acres developed (+55%), followed by Bucks County with an additional 53,900 acres developed (+44%). The pace of development, however, has been slowing: 10,460 acres were developed annually from 1990 to 2005 compared to 5,328 acres per year from 2005 to 2023—a 49% decrease. On a per capita basis, land consumption in the region’s rural areas increased 33% between 1990 and 2023—going from 0.39 to 0.51 acres per person—while growing suburbs (0.3 acres per person), developed communities (0.17 acres per person), and core cities (0.05 acres person) have held steady over this period.

The *Connections 2050* Plan maintains a goal of permanently preserving one million total acres in the region by 2040. As of 2020, the most recent year of record, Greater Philadelphia was about 63% of the way there, with 633,200 acres preserved. Since DVRPC's 2004 protected open space inventory, the total amount of protected land went up by 211,100 acres, or 50%. Over that 16-year period, preserved farmland more than doubled, adding 76,200 acres, while non-profit protected lands increased by 73,500 acres (+157%), and state-owned lands increased by 28,600 acres (+15%).

As of 2020, Burlington County had the most protected open space in the region, largely thanks to its overlap with New Jersey's protected Pinelands region, with 233,000 acres of preserved land. Chester County was second with 138,500 acres preserved, and Bucks County was third with 84,400 acres preserved. Rural areas account for 63% of all permanently protected open space in the region, with 396,600 acres.
