The region's roadways enable mobility and commerce throughout the region, as well as access to jobs, healthcare, education, recreation, and basic services. Pavement in poor condition slows down traffic and can cause unnecessary vehicle damage, and increase congestion and the cost of driving. Consumers ultimately pay for the cost of shipping, and some portion of nearly all goods movement trips is completed by truck. Therefore, how well we maintain the road network impacts how much we pay for the products and services we need or want—and savings generated by good road conditions have a positive impact on the economy.

This indicator reflects the _Connections 2050_ Plan goal to rebuild and modernize the region’s transportation assets in order to achieve and maintain a state-of-good repair. Roads can be kept in good condition with proper maintenance for a much lower cost than reconstructing a road that has fallen into a state of disrepair. Regular resurfacing and preservation help to maintain pavement in good condition, and ensures that our roads are smooth and safe for operation.
